                    <p>Do you know what you’re looking at over there on the right? It’s a brand-new freelance writer looking at one of her very first clips.<br><br>

On Thursdays, when the L.A. Reader came out, she would pack her new baby into the stroller, whip about eight blocks through the neighborhood trying to work off a bit of that post-pregnancy belly, and hit the nearest mini-mart to grab a copy.<br><br>

Or three, as you can see if you take a close look.<br><br>

Could she wait to get home to flip through the pages and find her byline?<br><br>

Nope.<br><br>

In case you haven’t guessed, that new freelance writer is me. (Dig the glasses! Never did stay up, so you can see me getting ready to give them yet another poke.)<br><br></p>

                    <p>No matter what your freelance niche is, there’s tons of advice out there that’s considered gospel. Just as there’s popular blogging advice that doesn’t always work, there’s popular freelancing advice that doesn’t always work either.<br><br>

New freelancers begin their career (if they don’t, they should) with research. They perform Google searches, scour tons of popular freelancing blogs to find out what the best freelancing practices are and have lots of conversations with established freelancers about how to start their own freelancing business.<br><br></p>
